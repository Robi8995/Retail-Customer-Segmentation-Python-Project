## 🎯 Project Objective

**Objective:** Segment retail customers based on purchasing patterns to identify VIP customers, inactive accounts, and high-potential prospects, enabling data-driven marketing strategies, retention programs, and personalized customer engagement.

**Dataset:** `synthetic_retail_transactions_1000.csv` | **Industry:** Retail & E-Commerce Analytics

**Problem Statement:**  
Retail businesses struggle with one-size-fits-all marketing approaches, leading to inefficient spend, poor customer retention, and missed revenue opportunities. Without customer segmentation, companies cannot identify high-value customers for VIP treatment, cannot reactivate churned customers effectively, and cannot allocate marketing budgets optimally. This project provides RFM-driven customer segmentation, behavioral profiling, and actionable insights to maximize customer lifetime value, improve retention rates, and optimize marketing ROI.

## 🔬 Methodology

### RFM Analysis Framework

**Recency (R):** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- Measures customer engagement and activity
- Lower recency = more recent activity = stronger engagement
- Inactive customers have high recency values (days since purchase)

**Frequency (F):** How often does the customer purchase?
- Measures customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior
- Higher frequency = more loyal customer
- Indicates strength of customer relationship

**Monetary (M):** How much does the customer spend?
- Measures customer value and revenue contribution
- Higher monetary = greater lifetime value
- Indicates purchasing power and high-value potential

### K-Means Clustering Algorithm

1. **Standardization:** Scale RFM metrics to remove unit bias
2. **Elbow Method:** Identify optimal cluster count (K) by analyzing inertia
3. **Initialization:** Start with K=4 clusters and random centroids
4. **Iteration:** Assign customers to nearest centroid and update centroids
5. **Convergence:** Repeat until centroid positions stabilize
6. **Validation:** Verify cluster separation and business interpretability

### Segment Profiling Strategy

- Compare mean RFM values across clusters
- Identify distinct behavioral patterns
- Map clusters to business-relevant customer segments
- Develop targeted strategies for each segment

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Step 1: Load & Clean Data
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("synthetic_retail_transactions_1000.csv", parse_dates=['InvoiceDate'])

# Data cleaning
df = df.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])
df = df[df['Amount'] > 0]
df['InvoiceNo'] = df['InvoiceNo'].astype(str)
```

### Step 2: Calculate RFM Metrics
```python
snapshot_date = df['InvoiceDate'].max() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

rfm = df.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
    'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (snapshot_date - x.max()).days,  # Recency
    'InvoiceNo': 'count',                                     # Frequency
    'Amount': 'sum'                                           # Monetary
}).reset_index()

rfm.columns = ['CustomerID', 'Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']
print(rfm.describe())
```

### Step 3: Explore RFM Distribution
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
plt.subplot(1,3,1)
sns.histplot(rfm['Recency'], kde=True, bins=20, color="skyblue")
plt.title('Recency Distribution')

plt.subplot(1,3,2)
sns.histplot(rfm['Frequency'], kde=True, bins=20, color="lightgreen")
plt.title('Frequency Distribution')

plt.subplot(1,3,3)
sns.histplot(rfm['Monetary'], kde=True, bins=20, color="salmon")
plt.title('Monetary Distribution')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Scale RFM Data
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
rfm_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(rfm[['Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']])
```

### Step 5: Find Optimal K using Elbow Method
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

inertia = []
K = range(2, 10)

for k in K:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    kmeans.fit(rfm_scaled)
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(K, inertia, marker='o')
plt.xlabel("Number of clusters (k)")
plt.ylabel("Inertia")
plt.title("Elbow Method for Optimal k")
plt.show()
```

### Step 6: Apply K-Means Clustering
```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42, n_init=10)
rfm['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_scaled)

cluster_summary = rfm.groupby('Cluster').agg({
    'Recency': 'mean',
    'Frequency': 'mean',
    'Monetary': ['mean', 'count']
}).round(1)
print(cluster_summary)
```

### Step 7: Visualize Customer Segments
```python
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))

sns.scatterplot(
    data=rfm, x="Frequency", y="Monetary",
    hue="Cluster", palette="Set2", s=100, ax=axes[0], edgecolor="k"
)
axes[0].set_title("Customer Segments (Frequency vs Monetary)", fontsize=14)

sns.scatterplot(
    data=rfm, x="Recency", y="Frequency",
    hue="Cluster", palette="Set2", s=100, ax=axes[1], edgecolor="k"
)
axes[1].set_title("Customer Segments (Recency vs Frequency)", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 8: Create Cluster Profile Heatmap
```python
cluster_profile = rfm.groupby("Cluster")[["Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary"]].mean()

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cluster_profile, annot=True, fmt=".1f", cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.title("Average RFM Values per Cluster", fontsize=14)
plt.show()
```

### Step 9: Assign Segment Labels
```python
cluster_labels = {
    0: "Churned / Inactive", 
    1: "Medium-Value Active", 
    2: "Recent Buyers", 
    3: "VIP / High-Value"
}
rfm['Segment'] = rfm['Cluster'].map(cluster_labels)

segment_counts = rfm['Segment'].value_counts()
print(segment_counts)
```

### Step 10: Visualize Segment Distribution
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.countplot(
    x='Segment',
    data=rfm,
    order=segment_counts.index,
    color="skyblue"
)
plt.title("Customer Segments Distribution", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Segment", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Number of Customers", fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(rotation=30)
plt.show()
```

### Step 11: Export Results
```python
# Export segmented customer data
rfm.to_csv('rfm_customer_segments.csv', index=False)

# Export cluster summary
cluster_summary.to_csv('cluster_summary.csv')

# Export by segment
for segment in rfm['Segment'].unique():
    segment_data = rfm[rfm['Segment'] == segment]
    filename = f'{segment.lower().replace(" ", "_")}_customers.csv'
    segment_data.to_csv(filename, index=False)
```
